## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
The lesson that I learned was not so technical this time. I had to learn to let the little things go while making this site. I spent more time than I want to admit worrying about small things, and in the end, simplicity was the key.
